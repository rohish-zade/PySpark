## What is Apache Spark?
Apache spark is a unified computing engine and set of libraries for parallel data processing on computer cluster.

Lets break down the definition: 

#### Unified Engine:
- Spark is design to support wide range of task over the same computing engine.
- for example: Data Scientist, Data Analyst and Data Engineers all can use the same platform for their analysis, transformation or modeling.
- Spark provides a single, unified engine for handling different types of big data processing workloads, including:
  - `Batch Processing:` Through the Spark Core API.
  - `Stream Processing:` Using Spark Streaming for real-time data.
  - `Machine Learning:` Through the MLlib library for scalable machine learning.
  - `Graph Processing:` Via the GraphX library for graph data processing.

#### Computing Engine:
- Spark is limited to computing engine. It doesn't store the data.
- Spark acts as the core framework that runs data operations on different types of data, whether structured or unstructured.
- Spark can connect with different data sources like `S3`, `ADLS`, `HDFS`, `JDBC/ODBC` etc.
- Spark works with almost all data storage.

#### Libraries:
Spark comes with built-in libraries for different tasks:
- `Spark SQL` for handling structured data.
- `MLlib` for machine learning.
- `GraphX` for graph processing.
- `Spark` Streaming for real-time stream processing.
 
Libraries are pre-written code collections that provide useful functions and modules, allowing developers to quickly implement common functionalities without building everything from scratch.

#### Parallel data processing:
- Spark can distribute the workload across multiple machines (nodes in a cluster) to process large amounts of data simultaneously, in parallel.
- Each node processes a portion of the data simultaneously to achieve faster and more efficient computation.

#### Computer Clusters:
- Spark works on clusters, which are groups of computers (nodes) working together together as a single system to perform tasks, typically by distributing workloads across multiple machines to increase performance, scalability, and fault tolerance..
- Each computer processes a portion of the data, enabling Spark to handle large datasets efficiently by distributing the load across the cluster.
- In a cluster we have master node and slave nodes.


## Why Apache Spark?

#### Big data problems with Hadoop
Despite its advantages, Hadoop faced several limitations:

**Performance Issues:** 
- `Disk I/O:` Hadoop’s reliance on disk-based storage and processing introduced significant latency, especially for iterative algorithms used in data analysis and machine learning.
- `Batch Processing:` Hadoop is primarily designed for batch processing, making it less effective for real-time data processing.

**Complexity**:
- Writing MapReduce jobs requires a steep learning curve and extensive boilerplate code, complicating development for many users.

**Limited Processing Capabilities:**
- `Single Paradigm:` Hadoop’s MapReduce model is not well-suited for all types of data processing tasks, particularly those requiring real-time analytics.

**High Latency:**
- `Slow Job Execution:` The intermediate data writing to disk during MapReduce jobs leads to high latency, making it unsuitable for low-latency applications.


#### How Spark Overcomes Hadoop Problems

- `Performance Improvements:` By leveraging in-memory computing, Spark significantly reduces processing times, especially for iterative tasks that are common in machine learning and data analysis.
- `Rich Ecosystem:` Spark provides a comprehensive set of libraries for various data processing tasks, making it a versatile platform for big data solutions.
- `Support for Real-Time Processing`: With Spark Streaming, organizations can process real-time data streams, enabling immediate insights and analytics.
- ` User-Friendly:` The high-level APIs and interactive programming capabilities of Spark make it easier for developers and data scientists to work with data.
