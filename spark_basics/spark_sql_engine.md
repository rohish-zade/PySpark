## Spark SQL Engine
- The Spark SQL engine is the core component of Apache Spark responsible for processing `structured` and `semi-structured data`.
- It powers Spark's ability to handle SQL queries, `DataFrames`, and `Datasets`. 
- It integrates with the `core Spark engine` to optimize and run SQL queries efficiently.
- Spark SQL engine is the underlying engine that enables Spark to handle structured data efficiently, optimizing both SQL queries and DataFrame-based operations with advanced query planning, optimization, and execution capabilities.
