    "The driver OOM occurs when the Spark driver process runs out of memory. Common driver memory issues include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Collect() Operation:**`\n",
    "- The collect operation in Spark retrieves data from distributed workers and consolidates it on the driver. \n",
    "- This can lead to OOM errors if the collected data is too large to fit into the driver's memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Broadcast Join:**\n",
    "- Broadcast joins are useful for optimizing joins when one side of the join is small enough to fit in memory. - - - However, if the broadcasted data is too large, it can exhaust driver memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Excessive Metadata or:**\n",
    "- The driver stores metadata about RDDs, DataFrames, tasks, and jobs. If the application creates too many objects or stages without proper garbage collection, the metadata can overwhelm the driver's memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improper Memory Allocation:**\n",
    "- Insufficient memory allocation for the driver (`spark.driver.memory` or `spark.driver.memoryOverhead`) can lead to OOM, especially for complex operations."
