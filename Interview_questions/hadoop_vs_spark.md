## Hadoop vs. Spark

Hadoop and Spark are both big data frameworks, but they have key differences in architecture, performance, and use cases.

### 1. **Processing Engine:**
- **Hadoop** uses **MapReduce** as its core processing model. It breaks tasks into map and reduce operations, which are disk-heavy and less efficient for iterative processes.
- **Spark** uses an **in-memory computation model**, which makes it much faster—often up to 100x for certain workloads—especially for iterative algorithms like machine learning and graph processing.

### 2. **Speed & Performance:**
- **Hadoop** writes intermediate data to disk after each MapReduce stage, which increases latency.
- **Spark** keeps data in memory (RAM) between operations using **Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)**, which dramatically improves performance for complex workflows.

### 3. **Ease of Use:**
- **Spark** provides APIs in **Python (PySpark)**, Scala, Java, and R, and includes high-level libraries like **Spark SQL**, **MLlib**, **GraphX**, and **Spark Streaming**, which makes it more developer-friendly.
- **Hadoop MapReduce** is mostly Java-based and lower-level, which means more boilerplate code and less abstraction.

### 4. **Fault Tolerance:**
- **Hadoop** achieves fault tolerance via data replication in HDFS and re-execution of failed tasks.
- **Spark** uses lineage information in RDDs to recompute only lost partitions, which is faster and more efficient in many cases.

### 5. **Use Cases:**
- **Hadoop** is better suited for batch processing jobs that aren’t time-sensitive.
- **Spark** excels in real-time or near-real-time processing, machine learning, interactive queries, and iterative workloads.

### 6. **Integration:**
- Both integrate with HDFS, Hive, HBase, and other components of the Hadoop ecosystem. In fact, Spark can run on top of Hadoop's YARN for resource management.

- Hadoop primarily for large-scale batch ETL pipelines where cost and stability were more important than speed. 
- Spark, on the other hand, is good building streaming data applications and complex analytics pipelines where latency and iterative computation matter.
